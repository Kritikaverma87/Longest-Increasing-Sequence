# Longest-Increasing-Sequence

The function takes as input an integer  input1 and an integer array  input2, containing  input1 number of integers, and sets the output1 variable to the length of its LIS (longest increasing sequence).

# Example 1: 
input1 = 9,
input2[] = {11,3,4,7,8,12,2,3,7},
Output1 should be 5.

# Explanation: 
In the given array input2, the two increasing sequences are “3,4,7,8,12” and “2,3,7”. The first sequence i.e. “3,4,7,8,12” is the longer one containing five items. So, the longest increasing sequence = 5.
